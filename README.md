# An overview of VGG and NiN models

This post aims to introduce briefly two classic convolutional neural networks, VGG16 and NiN (a.k.a Network in Network). We are going to discover their architectures as well as their implementations on the Keras platform. You can refer to my previous blogs for some related topics: Convolutional neural networks, LeNet, and Alexnet models.
